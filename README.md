## Prerequisites

Ensure the following software and tools are installed:

- **Node.js**: v16.x or later ([Download Here](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm**: v8.x or later (comes with Node.js)
- **Git**: v2.0 or later ([Download Here](https://git-scm.com/))

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srikanth230/Online-Complaint-Registration.git
cd code/backend
npm install
```

Customize the configuration file (`config.js`) to fit your environment (e.g., database settings).

---

## Usage

```bash
# Start the server
node index.js

# Optional: Run with live reload
npm install -g nodemon
nodemon index.js
```

The API runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default. Update the `config.js` file to change the port.

Use tools like Postman or `curl` to send requests and verify endpoints.
